          <tr>
            <td>– <em>Pilotd</em>

              A local JSON reverse-proxy to data layers web-services (almost
              everyone of them SOAP).
                
              Runs as a service, talks HTTP. Its purpose is to avoid writing
              libraries for every language used on the platform. By default it
              listens lo the loopback interface, making IPC overheads very low.
              
              All user-facing services can use it natively (HTTP/JSON) without
              having to be SOAP clients and its API better matches callers'
              needs, thus it requires little to no wrapper and is used as a
              library.
              
              But as it is a service you can easily have more than one version
              running at the same time making upgrades and migrations, even
              partial and long ones, easier.

              The daemon is written in C, statically compiled to ease
              deployment. The idea of its architecture comes from micro-kernel
              services.

            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>– <em>Event server</em>

              The event server is more a Zookeeper-like than a standard event
              server. The previous version stored event in three MySQL tables:
              services, identities, events and had problems coping with charge
              despite being coded as a C++ FCGI.

              I was in charge of a rewrite of the backend. I ended up using
              only one table (conditions) whose primary key was a product of
              the service and the identity. Also, rather than storing one line
              for each event I made the server store one line with the number
              of remaning events bfore condition is met. 

              This made it handle the load of calls from paid SMS,
              authentication blacklisting and lost password blacklisting
              combined.

              "Gendarmerie" (French army corpse dedicated to enforcement of the
              law on rural territory) declared they were in need of a solution
              to secure their Windows installations from the boot time.
              Solution involved a custom Debian installation CD (based on
              debian-installer, new at the time) and two grub modules: one to
              handle a USB mouse with fingerprint and pin readers, another to
              cipher/uncipher hard drive content before booting Windows.

              A prototype was made and shown but Gendarmerie's budget lines for
              the project were cancelled.
