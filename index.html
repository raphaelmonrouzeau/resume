          <h3>Pilotd</h3>

          <p> A local JSON reverse-proxy to data layers web-services (almost
          everyone of them SOAP). </p>
            
          <p> Runs as a service, talks HTTP. Its purpose is to avoid writing
          libraries for every language used on the platform. By default it
          listens lo the loopback interface, making IPC overheads very low.
          </p>
          
          <p> All user-facing services can use it natively (HTTP/JSON)
          without having to be SOAP clients and its API better matches
          callers' needs, thus it requires little to no wrapper and is used
          as a library. </p>
          
          <p> But as it is a service you can easily have more than one
          version running at the same time making upgrades and migrations,
          even partial and long ones, easier. </p>

          <p> The daemon is written in C, statically compiled to ease
          deployment. The idea of its architecture comes from micro-kernel
          services. </p>

          <h3>Event server</h3>

          <p> The event server is more a Zookeeper-like than a standard event
          server. The previous version stored event in three MySQL tables:
          services, identities, events and had problems coping with charge
          despite being coded as a C++ FCGI. </p>

          <p> I was in charge of a rewrite of the backend. I ended up using
          only one table (conditions) whose primary key was a product of the
          service and the identity. Also, rather than storing one line for each
          event I made the server store one line with the number of remaining
          events before condition is met. </p>

          <p> This made it handle the load of calls from paid SMS,
          authentication blacklisting and lost password blacklisting combined.
          </p>

          <h3>Authent form</h3>

          <p> The new authent form, in PHP was HTTPS only but had to show ads
          for certain kinds of consumers. Ad servers often load a lot of
          external resources by script, from locations they even can't predict
          and may be available in HTTPS or no. </p>
          
          <p> I had to make the form support both HTTP and HTTPS, with login
          POST, javascript activated or not, being always HTTPS, and without
          browser warnings. </p>
          
          <p> Actually this is not simple at all: POST in HTTP, JSONP and
          rewrote HTTPS support for the authent form </p>

          <p> IC4E is an american company operating in Russia, they needed
          their customers to be able to browse their ever growing catalog and
          choose the videos they wanted to broadcast. Before that content was
          identified by phone discussion then DAT tapes were mailed. </p>

          <p> I wrote a backend system where people were able to see
          automatically generated screenshots, snippets and request creation of
          a DRM encoded video or mail of a tape. They were able to choose
          timeframes of content that would be collected onto a single tape.
          Thus if mailed they received the minimum number of tapes and no
          content they didn't buy rights on. </p>
